## About Pythagoreanism
>Pythagoreanism originated in the 6th century BC, based on and around the teachings and beliefs held by Pythagoras and his followers, the Pythagoreans. Pythagoras established the first Pythagorean community in the ancient Greek colony of Kroton, in modern Calabria (Italy). Early Pythagorean communities spread throughout Magna Graecia.
>
>Pythagoras' death and disputes about his teachings led to the development of two philosophical traditions within Pythagoreanism. The akousmatikoi were superseded in the 4th century BC as a significant mendicant school of philosophy by the Cynics. The mathēmatikoi philosophers were absorbed into the Platonic school in the 4th century BC.
>
>Following political instability in Magna Graecia, some Pythagorean philosophers fled to mainland Greece while others regrouped in Rhegium. By about 400 BC the majority of Pythagorean philosophers had left Italy. Pythagorean ideas exercised a marked influence on Plato and through him, on all of Western philosophy. Many of the surviving sources on Pythagoras originate with Aristotle and the philosophers of the Peripatetic school.
>
>As a philosophic tradition, Pythagoreanism was revived in the 1st century BC, giving rise to Neopythagoreanism. The worship of Pythagoras continued in Italy and as a religious community Pythagoreans appear to have survived as part of, or deeply influenced, the Bacchic cults and Orphism."

## Modern Pythagoreanism
As our lives become more and more complex, so does the underlying science behind what makes that complexity possible. All of this complexity is based on lengthy calculations, models, code, physics and algorithms. 
Each separate individual being has its own capabilities of understanding and living in this complexity we call life. Every being therefore forms its own reality. Set of parameters and assumptions that are underlying what it thinks and does. But the only thing that connects all of those realitys is mathematics.

As bees, birds, humans and many creatures understand at least basic mathematics, so does the universe follow the sets of observable truth. And as we build a good enough understanding of them to build our own future with technology and science, not only do our realities become more mathematical, so do we understand more and more of the nature of things that came before it.

Modern Pythagoreanism is therefore a belief, that everything can be and will be explained in sufficient enough mathematics. Not only the statistically possible future, but us, the beginning and the end of the universe that we live in. And all our realities will be corrected and built with mathematics. Collecting us into one reality with one indisputable underlying truth - mathematics.
